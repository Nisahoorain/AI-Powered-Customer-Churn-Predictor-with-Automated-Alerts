For Students / Bootcamp Participants
Assignment Title:
Build an End-to-End AI Customer Churn Predictor with Automated Zapier Alerts
(Real-World Project – Exactly What Freelance Clients Pay $150–$400 For in 2025)
Deadline: 10 days
Deliverables to Submit:

GitHub repository (public)
Live Streamlit dashboard (free hosting)
Working Zapier automation (Slack OR Gmail OR Google Sheets)
2–3 minute Loom video demo
Short README explaining the business value

Step-by-Step Instructions (Follow Exactly)
Phase 1 – Days 1–2: Data & Model

Download the Telco Customer Churn dataset
→ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
Create a new GitHub repo named “customer-churn-zapier”
Train a churn model (Random Forest OR XGBoost/LightGBM – aim for ≥ 80% accuracy)
→ Save the trained model as churn_model.pkl
Create a Jupyter notebook “1_Train_Model.ipynb” showing:
EDA (at least 3 visualizations)
Preprocessing
Model training & evaluation
Feature importance plot


Phase 2 – Days 3–5: Streamlit Dashboard
5. Create churn_app.py 







Requirements the app MUST have:

File uploader (CSV/Excel)
Show churn probability for each customer
Highlight high-risk customers in red
Big green button “Send Alerts via Zapier”


Deploy for free on https://share.streamlit.io
→ You will get a public link like https://yourname-churn.streamlit.app

Phase 3 – Days 6–8: Zapier Automation
7. Sign up free at zapier.com
8. Create a new Zap → Trigger = “Webhooks by Zapier” → Catch Hook
→ Copy the webhook URL
9. Paste that URL into your Streamlit app code
10. Add at least ONE action (choose one or all):

Send Slack message to a channel
Send Gmail with customer name + probability
Add row to Google Sheet
Create task in Notion/ClickUp/Trello


Test end-to-end: upload a file → click button → see alert appear instantly

Phase 4 – Days 9–10: Polish & Submit
12. Record a 2–3 min Loom video showing:

Live dashboard
Uploading a file
Predictions appearing
Clicking the button → alert arriving in Slack/Gmail


Write a beautiful README.md with:
Project title & 2-sentence business value
Screenshots + live links
How to run locally
Tech stack list

Submit everything via Google Form (or wherever your instructor says)
